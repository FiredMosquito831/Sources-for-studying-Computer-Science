# Sources-for-studying-Computer-Science
This is a repo where I will store many sources sites courses etc that are mostly Free/Freemium some with Premium options, which I consider to be the best in offering us what we need to grow as a programmer, AI engineer, cybersec expert etc (many sources for example hyperskill and Microsoft and Google offer many options, while others are limited)
